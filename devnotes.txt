 * validate Handler dependencies
 * -postponed,workaround:XmlRestrictFields- deepCopy using dependencies
 * indexing status notification
 * present status in webapp
 * status notification for use with hooks
 * -done- cms-backend support for isOverwritten
 * -done- use isOverwritten in indexing-xml to skip add and delete
 * use isOverwritten in ReposIndexingImpl to skip head update

   - we need some way to clean up temp files or big reindex runs will fill the disk
 * we could replace blocking/background with configurable scheduling rules, where the list of handlers could include entries like "wait for later revision's handlers up to X milliseconds" and "enable content buffer", "destroy content buffer"
